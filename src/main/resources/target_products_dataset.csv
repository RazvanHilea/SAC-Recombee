The Art of Community - by  Charles Vogl (Paperback),51413426,"  Book Synopsis Create a Culture of Belonging!  Strong cultures help people support one another, share their passions, and achieve big goals. And such cultures of belonging aren't just happy accidents - they can be purposefully cultivated, whether they're in a company, a faith institution or among friends and enthusiasts. Drawing on 3,000 years of history and his personal experience, Charles Vogl lays out seven time-tested principles for growing enduring, effective and connected communities. He provides hands-on tools for creatively adapting these principles to any group--formal or informal, mission driven or social, physical or virtual. This book is a guide for leaders seeking to build a vibrant, living culture that will enrich lives.  Winner of the Nautilus Silver Book Award in the Business and Leadership Category.  Review Quotes ""The Art of Community is a powerful, practical, and modern articulation of, and advancement on, timeless wisdom. Emerging or veteran leaders who integrate these principles will build communities that are more resilient, passionate, and harmonious in the face of adversity and uncertainty. Flip to any page to find insight and inspiration.""  --Alan Price, Founding Director, Global Leadership Initiative, Harvard Business School, and author of Ready To Lead?  ""A useful field guide to create durable and profound connections . . . An important undertaking, as isolation and loneliness are a root cause of the breakdowns all around us, including extreme violence.""  --Peter Block, author of Community and Flawless Consulting  ""At last, here is an insightful guide to create the community you have envisioned for yourself and others."" --Richard Leider, best selling author of the Power of Purpose and Life Reimagined  ""A brilliantly intentional, well-composed plan for engaging and developing communities. This book is both an inspiration and a field guide for those who wish to connect deeply and build the communities our world so desperately needs."" --Thomas A. Kolditz, PhD, Brigadier General, US Army (ret.), and Director, Ann and John Doerr Institute for New Leaders  ""This book is full of rich wisdom and simple tools to help make community real. Our mission statement includes the word 'community, ' but I never truly understood what it meant until reading this book. Too often we declare a community around affiliation without digging into the shared values and care for one another that make a real community.""  --Jason Jay, PhD, Director, Sustainability Initiative, MIT Sloan School of Management, and author of Beyond the Choir  ""A deeply thoughtful and compelling book that shares many insights with clarity, accessible examples, and ideas for implementation. I learned a lot.""  --Lawrence Levy, former CFO. Pixar Animation Studios; cofounder, Juniper Foundation; and author of To Pixar and Beyond  ""Charles Vogl's book is a lucid, ferociously intelligent, and readily accessible road map to building a more connected culture. Education about community and character has been subordinated in American education to myopic cognitive and commercial learning. The result everywhere around us is devastating, from unprecedented wealth disparities to rampant tribalism. This work points to a much-needed antidote."" --Marty Krasney, Executive Director, Dalai Lama Fellows  ""I've personally experienced the magic that Charles Vogl creates in powerful communities. People feel genuine belonging and connection. Now he has written down the essential principles so that others may experience this magic themselves. I cannot imagine a more important subject for a book in a society where so many of us hunger for connection and community.""  --Scott Sherman, Executive Director, Transformative Action Institute  ""The Art of Community is an outstanding guide to creating and fostering the meaningful communities all of us need. As technology that allows us to physically detach from one another accelerates, it has become more important than ever to understand what community and belonging mean. Strong, mature communities benefit both individuals and humanity as a whole.""  --Jonathan Knowles, Explorer in Residence, Autodesk, and host of the Autodesk IDEAS series  ""If you are tasked with bringing families, neighborhoods, or organizations together, read this book first. In The Art of Community, author Charles Vogl re-invigorates a vision of community and the importance of social bonds to our well-being. In place of our convenient and transient associations, Vogl tells us how to establish relationships that are more meaningful and enduring.""  --Michael O'Malley, author or coauthor of Every Leader Is an Artist, The Wisdom of Bees, and Leading with Kindness",https://www.target.com/p/the-art-of-community-by-charles-vogl-paperback/-/A-51413426,https://target.scene7.com/is/image/Target/GUEST_64bc92e2-8cc3-4239-a529-0b21af870d02

The Arab of the Future 2 - by  Riad Sattouf (Paperback),51411246,"  About the Book ""Originally published in France in 2015 by Allary aEditions""--Colophon.  Book Synopsis The highly anticipated continuation of Riad Sattouf's internationally acclaimed, #1 French bestseller, which was hailed by The New York Times as ""a disquieting yet essential read""In The Arab of the Future: Volume 1, cartoonist Riad Sattouf tells of the first years of his childhood as his family shuttles back and forth between France and the Middle East. In Libya and Syria, young Riad is exposed to the dismal reality of a life where food is scarce, children kill dogs for sport, and his cousins, virulently anti-Semitic and convinced he is Jewish because of his blond hair, lurk around every corner waiting to beat him up. In Volume 2, Riad, now settled in his father's hometown of Homs, gets to go to school, where he dedicates himself to becoming a true Syrian in the country of the dictator Hafez Al-Assad. Told simply yet with devastating effect, Riad's story takes in the sweep of politics, religion, and poverty, but is steered by acutely observed small moments: the daily sadism of his schoolteacher, the lure of the black market, with its menu of shame and subsistence, and the obsequiousness of his father in the company of those close to the regime. As his family strains to fit in, one chilling, barbaric act drives the Sattoufs to make the most dramatic of changes. Darkly funny and piercingly direct, The Arab of the Future, Volume 2 once again reveals the inner workings of a tormented country and a tormented family, delivered through Riad Sattouf's dazzlingly original talent.  Review Quotes ""Sattouf's story and storytelling [are] irresistible. . . . Living betwixt and between cultures may be Sattouf's destiny. It was hard on him as a child, and it may remain so in adulthood. But it makes for exceptionally good art."" --The New York Times""A deft and devastating graphic memoir . . . both sensitive and biting . . . Along the way, we get a fine-grained, first-person account of the brutality of Syria under Hafez al-Assad and Libya under Muammar Qaddafi."" --New York Review of Books""Sattouf is a master of visual storytelling, capable of compressing a great deal of human emotion and contradictions within a few panels. He creates a searing depiction of growing up poor in a country ruled by corruption and religious zealotry."" --Publishers Weekly""Nothing escapes Sattouf's curious and vigilant eyes. . . . Using the magic of his visual storytelling, Sattouf becomes a darkly humorous, poignant, and vivid guide into the mind of Syrians."" --Christian Science Monitor""Darkly ironic . . . Sattouf's father is the same immature, posturing figure familiar from volume 1--the family can only trail along in the mercurial patriarch's wake. Under Sattouf's pen, this state of affairs becomes an ingeniously apt microcosm of the larger world he grew up in."" --NPR""A darker book than its predecessor, though it's still drily funny, Sattouf never failing to make the most of the aching gap between his father's fantasies and reality."" --The Guardian (Graphic Novel of the Month)""The scope of Sattouf's comic is remarkable, taking in the complicated landscape of politics and religion, but it is in the small, human moments that he shines as an artist. . . . The Arab of the Future is essential read that deserves such a phenomenal sequel."" --Largehearted Boy""This work will undoubtedly win more accolades as the author continues the proposed five-volume series. Readers familiar with Marjane Satrapi's Persepolis will be well rewarded when they pick up this similarly engrossing book."" --Library Journal  About the Author Riad Sattouf is a best-selling cartoonist and filmmaker who grew up in Syria and Libya and now lives in Paris. The author of several comics series in France and a former contributor to the satirical publication Charlie Hebdo, Sattouf is now a weekly columnist for l'Obs.

Golden Keys to Ascension and Healing - (Easy-To-Read Encyclopedia of the Spiritual Path) by  Joshua David Stone (Paperback),78153193,"  About the Book Many of you on Earth are talking about ascension. You are talking about ascending, that is, raising frequency. We want to talk with you about this. First, there isn't just one ascension. It is a process. It is happening now--on your planet and in other universes. It is a cooperation of energies working together. Many people on Earth are working together, and you are joined by the energies of other universes to assist you in your endeavor because they have the same goal. When you increase vibration, so do they. When you raise frequency, so do they. When you improve, so do they. When you vibrate at a faster speed, when you make corrections of earthly errors, so to speak, they benefit and there is a collective sigh of relief in the heavens. Death of the body is one form of ascension. It is a process, not a static state, and it is a rather effective and efficient one we might add, because one form of density is shed at the moment of death of the body and the spirit is free to soar and t  Book Synopsis This book represents the wisdom of the ascended master condensed into concise keys that serve as a spiritual guide. These 420 golden keys present the multitude of insights Dr. Stone has gleaned from his own background and his path to God realization.",https://www.target.com/p/golden-keys-to-ascension-and-healing-easy-to-read-encyclopedia-of-the-spiritual-path-by-joshua-david-stone-paperback/-/A-78153193,https://target.scene7.com/is/image/Target/GUEST_0237ed85-78d7-41fe-8758-ac8ae0d03fbb

A Dog's Heart - by  Mikhail Bulgakov (Paperback),78154537,"  Book Synopsis Through surreal, often grotesque humour, Bulgakov gives an ingenious new twist to the ""Frankenstein"" parable, in a new translation of one of the most popular satires on the Russian Revolution and on Soviet societyHaving been scalded by boiling water earlier that day, and with little chance to survive the severe winter night, a stray dog is left for dead on the streets. Lamenting his fate, he is ill-prepared for the chance arrival of a wealthy professor who befriends him and takes him home. However, it seems the professor's motives are not entirely altruistic--an expert in medical experimentation, he sees his new charge as the potential subject for a bizarre operation, and implants glands from a dead criminal in the dog. The resulting half-man, half-beast is, as to be expected, a monstrosity, yet one that fits in remarkably well with Soviet society.  About the Author Mikhail Bulgakov is best known for The Master and Margarita, widely hailed as one of the greatest novels of the 20th century. A. S. Byatt is the acclaimed Booker-prize winning author of such works as The Biographer's Tale, The Children's Book, Little Black Book of Stories, and Possession.",https://www.target.com/p/a-dog-s-heart-by-mikhail-bulgakov-paperback/-/A-78154537,https://target.scene7.com/is/image/Target/GUEST_9d51d663-c20f-41fb-aa1c-a43dc6e96205

Inside Your Insides - by  Claire Eamer (Hardcover),78155516,"  About the Book Discusses ""the good and the bad (and possibly a few ugly) microscopic organisms that live in you and on you""--Page 4 of cover.  Book Synopsis ""Wherever you go, tiny hitchhikers tag along for the ride,"" this intriguing illustrated nonfiction book begins. ""The hitchhikers are actually microbes --- tiny living things so small that you need a microscope to see them. And every person carries around trillions and trillions of these critters."" Six of the most common ""critters"" that live in and on our bodies are introduced here: bacteria, archaea, viruses, fungi, protists and mites. Each one has its own preferred environment, and readers will be startled (and likely a little grossed out!) by the many places they live, including the hair follicles on our faces, the folds of our tongues and the lengths of our guts. Just as surprising, only some of them are ""bad guys"" that cause disease, and many of them are actually ""good guys"" that keep us healthy. There's even research currently being done on ways to improve or fix our collection of microbes as a way to make us healthier. Author Claire Eamer's clear, well-organized and accessible writing --- augmented throughout with fun facts and silly microbe jokes in sidebars --- keeps the book interesting and enjoyable. Marie-Ève Tremblay's bright and cheerfully funny illustrations bring the details to delightful life. With its cutting-edge information about a topic children will find fascinating, this book makes an excellent complement to a life science lesson on the human body. It would also work well for a class on healthy living. A table of contents, glossary and index are included.  Review Quotes ... children will pore over it with fascination, no doubt exclaiming, ""Ooh, gross!"" at frequent intervals!--Canadian Children's Book News... this book has an agenda that's easy to get behind.--Montreal Review of BooksAn excellent example of engaging science writing, this title would be a useful mentor text for young science writers and a fine addition to science programs dealing with the topic of the human body.--School Library Journal - starred reviewMicrobiology is an unlikely topic for a younger reader, however, this book describes in detail, and with much humour, the many microbes that live in, on and around us every day.--Resource LinksMicrobiology might seem like a complex subject to broach with middle-graders, but in her new book, Claire Eamer succeeds in explaining the basics in terms that kids will understand.--Quill & QuireSolid information presented in a sprightly manner that's sure to appeal.--Kirkus ReviewsThe information presented is scientific, intensely personal, and fun to know.--School Library Connection  About the Author Marie-Ève Tremblay is a travel junkie who finds inspiration in her trips abroad, be it from nature or situations in everyday life. Her take on the world is full of affection and humor, and her images are set apart by their warm tones, curious candor and gentle whimsy. She has illustrated numerous children's books, as well as for magazines, TV series and much more.

Karol Radziszewski - by  Michal Grzegorzek (Hardcover),82397823,"  Book Synopsis Karol Radziszewski's montage of queer archival materials that formulate new ways of understanding history, memory, and legislation in Eastern Europe. In 1989, a great political change awaited Poland: with the fall of the Berlin wall and the flourishing of capitalism, the people behind the Iron Curtain would be set free. Karol Radziszewski was nine years old, living in Bialystok, and, in a graph-paper notebook, he drew pages and pages of princesses in corrective eyewear, dogs with mermaid tails, and mysterious seductresses, whose exceptionally firm bosoms would be, sooner or later, bedecked in arrows shot into a heart or a flame. Karol knows that the secrets of these notebooks were off limits to everyone. Today these drawings reemerge as self-portraits of this adult artist: full-fledged works capping off Radziszewski's enormous queer archive. For he himself is a man of many faces: artist, curator, film director, and avid collector, skillfully navigating between the visual and performative arts. But above all, he is the creator of the Queer Archives Institute, a never-ending performance and informal organization grappling with the suppressed, yet surprisingly beautiful queer memory of Central and Eastern Europe. The artist's special montage of archival materials--self-made, ready-made, or inspiration for artistic extrapolation--formulates new ways of understanding history, memory, or legislation. He blurs facts with fantasies, cobbling together documentation from scraps of memories. He leaves false trails to suggest alternative paths of remembering. The secret performativity of Karol Radziszewski's archive is not merely in its tales of the past, but above all, in the queer potential of the future: in its revolutionary nature, its change, and its promise of freedom.

Play Anything - by  Ian Bogost (Hardcover),51528237,"  About the Book ""Life is boring: filled with meetings and traffic, errands and emails. Nothing we'd ever call fun. But what if we've gotten fun wrong? In Play Anything, visionary game designer and philosopher Ian Bogost shows how we can overcome our daily anxiety; transforming the boring, ordinary world around us into one of endless, playful possibilities. The key to this playful mindset lies in discovering the secret truth of fun and games. Play Anything, reveals that games appeal to us not because they are fun, but because they set limitations. Soccer wouldn't be soccer if it wasn't composed of two teams of eleven players using only their feet, heads, and torsos to get a ball into a goal; Tetris wouldn't be Tetris without falling pieces in characteristic shapes. Such rules seem needless, arbitrary, and difficult. Yet it is the limitations that make games enjoyable, just like it's the hard things in life that give it meaning. Play is what happens when we accept these limitations, narrow our focus, and, consequently, have fun. Which is also how to live a good life. Manipulating a soccer ball into a goal is no different than treating ordinary circumstances- like grocery shopping, lawn mowing, and making PowerPoints-as sources for meaning and joy. We can ""play anything"" by filling our days with attention and discipline, devotion and love for the world as it really is, beyond our desires and fears. Ranging from Internet culture to moral philosophy, ancient poetry to modern consumerism, Bogost shows us how today's chaotic world can only be tamed-and enjoyed-when we first impose boundaries on ourselves""--  Book Synopsis How filling life with play-whether soccer or lawn mowing, counting sheep or tossing Angry Birds -- forges a new path for creativity and joy in our impatient age  Life is boring: filled with meetings and traffic, errands and emails.

Review Quotes Play Anything is nothing short of brilliant. It proves that philosophy can fun, that fun can be profound, and that play is in fact the bridge that connects what is most meaningful and what is most pleasurable in our daily lives. I will be recommending this provocative and entertaining book to everyone I know. -Jane McGonigal, bestselling author of Reality is Broken and SuperBetterThis is one of those books that blossoms: now tacking through intellectual history, now seizing on philosophical argument, now touched by memoir. At its hybrid heart, you'll find the meaning of 'play, ' as well as 'fun, ' and maybe even 'life.' Maybe you pick it up because, like me, you're a fan of Ian Bogost's essays, or maybe because you've enjoyed one of his previous books. No matter how you approach it, Play Anything will surprise you. You'll realize: this is a book with big ambitions, carrying a theory of the world that is covertly radical and, by the end, nothing short of thrilling. -Robin Sloan, bestselling author of Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore[Bogost's] thoughtful book Play Anything makes the point that life's limitations--as with the limitations of a game such as soccer or Tetris--are not impediments to our enjoyment, but rather, what make life or the game fun in the first place.-New York TimesA landmark. Play Anything is a humane and personal theory of play for the supermodern age. Full of fascinating insight and fresh perspective, Play Anything shows how play serves as a fundamental tool for examining the world around us. Through play we limit, focus, constrain and experiment into order to bring certain aspects of our world to the fore while allowing others to recede. As the basis both for creativity and for well-being, as well as the antidote to detached irony, play is how we all recognize our Davids, big and small, from the infinite blocks of marble all around us. -Stewart Butterfield, CEO of Slack TechnologiesPlay Anything is a profound book: both a striking assessment of our current cultural landscape, and at the same time a smart self-improvement guide, teaching us the virtues of a life lived playfully. -Steven Johnson, bestselling author of How We Got to Now and Everything Bad is Good for YouAn erudite and often amusing book. -Wall Street JournalPlay Anything isn't really just an argument for turning dull tasks into games. It's a manifesto for a different attitude to the world. -Guardian (UK)I can tell you that a great way to have fun with the job of writing a book review-to play while writing it-is by pursuing it earnestly and seriously as a book review. A humble, highly constrained genre. You tell people about the book. You tell them whether you think it's worth reading. (Yes.) And then, instead of allowing your ego to ruin everything by trying to make it cool, you move on in search of the next playground. -Slate An essential read for those seeking to understand how a new idea of play can be positive for our lives. -Library Journal, starred review[Bogost's] arguments are thoughtful and useful for approaching ordinary experiences. A delightful book that promotes playfulness with a purpose. -Kirkus Reviews It's difficult to imagine a book that takes on David Foster Wallace, Barry Schwartz, Mary Poppins, and a host of philosophers under one premise. Yet Bogost, professor of interactive computing at the Georgia Institute of Technology and founding partner at a video games company, has done so. -Publishers Weekly Empowering, fresh, and engaged. -Kill ScreenFor anyone who cares or works with or thinks about things like fun, enjoyment, happiness, play, and games, Play Anything is a conceptual thrill ride. Poetic. Deeply philosophical. Refreshingly insightful. It will challenge almost everything that you think you know about play, and then lift you towards a new and remarkably freeing perspective on everything else. -Deep FunPart personal meditation, part guide to living a happier life, Play Anything is a Walden for the 2010s. -New Scientist Play Anything is a one-stop workshop for how to play in the 21st century... a manifesto, and it declares that more recess is good for the soul. Maybe pick this one up in your off-time. -San Francisco Book Review Proposing an aesthetic of play, [Bogost] draws on myriad examples, from golf to the task of watering his lawn to his daughter's self-directed rules of 'step on a crack, break your mother's back.' ...[the] idea-driven prose of PLAY ANYTHING might remind you of the applied-philosophy tactics of an Alain de Botton... demonstrate[s] the importance of thoughtful, serious criticism on gaming and play. -New York Times Book Review Of all the books on this list, this may be the hardest to describe, and in my assessment that was an asset. The year saw a few new entries in the 'Tackle life's challenges like a game' category, a thesis that's gaining momentum, but this book goes deeper than most via an enlightening discussion of the role of limits in both games and life. Bogost strikes me as equal parts philosopher and savant game enthusiast-a systems thinker with a penchant for high score formulas-and I'm glad he wrote Play Anything because it's causing me to look at problems in a different way. Read it and I think you'll see why.-Dan DiSalvo, Forbes.com, Best Brain Books of 2016   About the Author Ian Bogost is the Ivan Allen College Distinguished Chair in media studies and a professor of interactive computing at the Georgia Institute of Technology, a founding partner at Persuasive Games, and a contributing editor at the Atlantic.

Her only companions are her faithful dog and partner in crime, Fox--and Sly Boots, the shy boy who lets her live in his attic when it's too cold to sleep on the rooftops.

She could maybe even find her parents. What she does find, however, is much more complicated and surprising. . . .Acclaimed author Claire Legrand's stunning and original novel explores the danger of lies and the power of truth, the strength found in friendship, and the value of loving and being loved . . . even if it means risking your heart.

Town - by  Royal Wade Kimes (Paperback),79293565,"  About the Book A crudely lettered sign reading ""TOWN"" marked a narrow road just off the main trail. The newly erected sign was surely seen as a welcome to westbound wagons in need of a place to rest and replenish supplies before continuing their long journey. It was not.  Book Synopsis A crudely lettered sign reading ""TOWN"" marked a narrow road just off the main trail. The sun barely gave light to an entrance to a road that led downward to a ghost town at the bottom of a small canyon. The newly erected sign was surely seen as a welcome to westbound wagons in need of a place to rest and replenish supplies before continuing their long journey. It was not.The new residents, of Town, were the Suggs family. The head of the family was Pa-Dad, who led and ruled with an iron fist, his four sons, a daughter, and Mammy. The male members of the family were crack shots with their fifty caliber rifles. They were ruthless, raping scavengers, murdering and taking from those crossing the Texas Plains by wagon. During one of their murderous attacks Pa-Dad let his horse fall on him and break his leg. This forced Pa-Dad to rethink how to continue their prospering evil ways. The result was their new residence and the sign.What Pa-Dad didn't realize was how quickly the sign would work and who and what it would bring in. Before he was ready for it, 'pilgrims', as he liked to call them were coming in faster than he could shackle or shoot them. And he was finding out that even the best laid plans of mice and men can really get out of hand. His biggest problem was not secondhand stolen money, a retired sheriff, an English countess and her escorts, the daughter of a gunslinging marshal, the woman who escaped one of his raids, or those involved in the previously stolen double eagles numbering in the thousands... it was Kenneth Luker.  Review Quotes ""TOWN"" is a start to finish masterpiece, made so by a brilliant electrifying story with compelling characters. It is a novel with one twist and turn following another right up to the end. The ending is top shelf pro.

Tilting at Time - by  Greg Tome (Paperback),79293572,"  Book Synopsis 'Tilting at Time offers a vivacious yet emphatic rendering of the minutiae of Australian life. At once humorous and reflective, Greg muses on the human condition and its relationship to the specific places and temporal spaces we find ourselves in. In the very first poem, our poet expresses his wish for ""words that...shine light into hidden crevices, expose fires"". It is in his own collection that we find exactly that.' - Lucy Petchell'In this collection, Greg Tome's eyes are everywhere, playfully or ruminatively considering much that is revealed to the observant poet. His poems survey the grace of human attachment, the remarkable beauty of the everyday world as well as its unexpected terrors, drawing the reader's attention to the richly imaginative prospect that this poet variously shares. Tome's dexterous management of the language in these poems stylistically suggests the pace of an inner life that embraces and rejoices in the range of sensitivity that is life. The reader of this work will inevitably savour the wonder of living found in this writer's sometime quirky, always questioning vision.' - Michael Cotter'This is a rich collection from a very accomplished poet. The richness comes from the range of topics, the breadth of treatments, and the author's experience, imagination, powers of observation and wit. There is never a dull moment as we read of adventures, philosophy, nature, religion, fantasy, love and lust. Few can have their head in the clouds at the same time as having their feet on the ground, and Greg Tome is one of the few.' - Brian Haydon",https://www.target.com/p/tilting-at-time-by-greg-tome-paperback/-/A-79293572,https://target.scene7.com/is/image/Target/GUEST_d2767b4c-6cc9-4d16-9845-19ccdef41afe

Inferno - (Modern Library Classics (Mass Market)) by  Dante (Paperback),77024343,"  About the Book This groundbreaking bilingual edition of Dante's masterpiece includes a substantive Introduction, extensive notes, and appendices that reproduce Dante's key sources and influences.  Book Synopsis An extraordinary new verse translation of Dante's masterpiece, by poet, scholar, and lauded translator Anthony Esolen Of the great poets, Dante is one of the most elusive and therefore one of the most difficult to adequately render into English verse. In the Inferno, Dante not only judges sin but strives to understand it so that the reader can as well. With this major new translation, Anthony Esolen has succeeded brilliantly in marrying sense with sound, poetry with meaning, capturing both the poem's line-by-line vigor and its allegorically and philosophically exacting structure, yielding an Inferno that will be as popular with general readers as with teachers and students. For, as Dante insists, without a trace of sentimentality or intellectual compromise, even Hell is a work of divine art. Esolen also provides a critical Introduction and endnotes, plus appendices containing Dante's most important sources--from Virgil to Saint Thomas Aquinas and other Catholic theologians--that deftly illuminate the religious universe the poet inhabited.  Review Quotes ""Dante's conversations with his mentor Virgil and the doomed shades are by turns assertive and abashed, irritated and pitying and inquisitive, and Anthony Esolen's new translation renders them so sensitively that they seem to take place in the same room with us. It follows Dante through all his spectacular range, commanding where he is commanding, wrestling, as he does, with the density and darkness in language and in the soul. This Inferno gives us Dante's vivid drama and his verbal inventiveness. It is living writing."" --James Richardson, Princeton University ""Professor Esolen's translation of Dante's Inferno is the best one I have seen, for two reasons. His decision to use unrhymed blank verse allows him to come nearly as close to the meaning of the original as any prose reading could do, and allows him also to avoid the harrowing sacrifices that the demand for rhyme imposes on any translator. And his endnotes and other additions provoke answers to almost any question that could arise about the work."" --A. Kent Hieatt, professor emeritus, University of Western Ontario ""Esolen's brilliant translation captures the power and the spirit of a poem that does not easily give up its secrets. The notes and appendices provide exactly the kind of help that most readers will need."" --Robert Royal, president, Faith and Reason Institute  About the Author The Modern Library has played a significant role in American cultural life for the better part of a century. The series was founded in 1917 by the publishers Boni and Liveright and eight years later acquired by Bennett Cerf and Donald Klopfer. It provided the foundation for their next publishing venture, Random House. The Modern Library has been a staple of the American book trade, providing readers with affordable hardbound editions of important works of literature and thought. For the Modern Library's seventy-fifth anniversary, Random House redesigned the series, restoring as its emblem the running torch-bearer created by Lucian Bernhard in 1925 and refurbishing jackets, bindings, and type, as well as inaugurating a new program of selecting titles.

Entre Las Sombras del Sueño Americano - by  Julissa Arce (Paperback),51534719,"  About the Book ""When she was 11 years old Julissa Arce left Mexico and came to the United States on a tourist visa to be reunited with her parents, who dreamed the journey would secure her a better life. When her visa expired at the age of 15, she became an undocumented immigrant. Thus began her underground existence, a decades long game of cat and mouse, tremendous family sacrifice, and fear of exposure. After the Texas Dream Act made a college degree possible, Julissa's top grades and leadership positions landed her an internship at Goldman Sachs, which led to a full time position""--  Book Synopsis ¿Qué aspecto tiene una inmigrante indocumentada? ¿De qué tipo de familia proviene? ¿Cómo consigue entrar a este país? ¿Cuál es el verdadero precio que debe pagar para quedarse en los Estados Unidos? Julissa Arce sabe por experiencia propia que las respuestas más comunes y preconcebidas a esas preguntas son con frecuencia demasiado sencillas, y a veces totalmente erróneas.A primera vista, Arce ha alcanzado el sueño americano: al conseguir finalmente un empleo muy codiciado en Wall Street después de años de esfuerzo académico. Pero en esta valiente autobiografía, Arce revela el costo físico, económico y emocional del asombroso secreto que ella, al igual que muchos otros individuos en los Estados Unidos que logran mucho a pesar de sus circunstancias, se había visto obligada a ocultar no solo de sus jefes sino también de sus amigos más cercanos.Desde el momento en que sus padres la trajeron a este país cuando era una niña, Arce, la ganadora de una beca, la graduada universitaria con honores, la joven que finalmente llegó a ser vicepresidenta en Goldman Sachs, había vivido en secreto como inmigrante indocumentada.En esta historia personal desgarradora e inspiracional de lucha, tristeza y redención final, Arce lleva a los lectores a las profundidades de un mundo poco entendido de una nueva generación de inmigrantes indocumentados que están actualmente en los Estados Unidos.Al sincerarse sobre la historia de su largo viaje de lucha para llegar a ser ciudadana estadounidense, Arce nos muestra el verdadero costo de alcanzar el sueño americano, desde la perspectiva de una mujer que tuvo que superar muros invisibles e inimaginables para llegar hasta ahí.  About the Author Julissa Arce es escritora, oradora y defensora de la justicia social. Es la cofundadora y presidenta de Ascend Educational Fund, un programa de becas universitarias y mentoría para capacitar a estudiantes inmigrantes. Julissa también es miembro de la junta directiva de National Immigration Law Center y de College Spring.

Fathoming the Mind - by  B Alan Wallace (Paperback),53998045,"  Book Synopsis Bestselling author B. Alan Wallace delivers the long-awaited followup to his Stilling the Mind: Shamatha Teachings from Dudjom Lingpa's Vajra Essence (2011). Fathoming the Mind continues the commentary to Dudjom Lingpa's Vajra Essence that appeared in Stilling the Mind, daringly contextualizing Buddhist teachings on the Great Perfection as a revolutionary challenge to many contemporary beliefs. This companion volume stems from an oral commentary that B. Alan Wallace gave to the next section of the Vajra Essence, on the cultivation of contemplative insight, or vipashyana, that fathoms the nature of existence as a whole. Dudjom Lingpa's revelation consists of a fascinating dialogue that occurred during his pure vision of Samantabhadra, personification of primordial consciousness, manifesting as the youthful form of the Lake-born Vajra emanation of Padmasambhava, in dialogue with an entourage of bodhisattvas symbolizing various aspects of Dudjom Lingpa's mind.  In continuing to reflect on Dudjom Lingpa's writings and their relevance to the modern world, Wallace was inspired to elaborate extensively on his original commentary. This book includes introductory essays and an afterword, which explore how the insights discussed here might contribute to yet a new ""contemplative revolution,"" one that would be as far-reaching in its implications as the scientific revolutions triggered by the discoveries of Galileo, Darwin, and Einstein.  Review Quotes ""This is a fascinating book. Continuing his impressive unpacking of the legacy of Dudjom Lingpa, Alan Wallace has produced a fine contribution to the long history of oral commentary on source texts. His grasp of the subject matter is impressive, as is the way he weaves in references to Western thought and scientific inquiry that places Dudjom Lingpa's text in a more relevant context. I highly recommend this book to all who are serious about having a mind and working with it.""--Richard Barron (Chökyi Nyima), translator of Longchenpa's The Precious Treasury of the Way of Abiding, and The Precious Treasury of the Basic Space of Phenomenawith its autocommentary""Fathoming the Mind lucidly focuses Buddhism's present-day encounter with modernity on one of the most potent possibilities: that cognitive science is poised on the threshold of major revolution and the Buddhist worldview offers a profound opportunity to expand into radically new and necessary territory. This book contains a map of what Buddhist teachings about mind and reality can offer contemporary science. And Alan Wallace, with his deep understanding of both physical science and Buddhist philosophy and practice, is an exceptional guide.""--David E. Presti, University of California, Berkeley, author of Foundational Concepts in Neuroscience (W.W. Norton, 2016) and Mind Beyond Brain (Columbia University Press, 2018)""This book invites us to enjoy an illuminating journey through the terrain of a classic Tibetan text on the nature and practice of insight meditation.  Like an experienced trekking guide who knows the territory well, Alan Wallace points out features of the landscape with easeful erudition and the deft use of analogy. Along the way, he comes up with all sorts of useful tools and materials just when the reader needs them--these being the words of Western scientists and philosophers, and Eastern sages and adepts, which he draws on with equal familiarity and adroitness.""--Ajahn Amaro, abbot of Amaravati Buddhist Monastery, UK  About the Author Dynamic lecturer, progressive scholar, and one of the most prolific writers and translators of Tibetan Buddhism in the West, B. Alan Wallace continually seeks innovative ways to integrate Buddhist contemplative practices with Western science to advance the study of the mind. Dr. Wallace has taught Buddhist theory and meditation worldwide since 1976. Having devoted fourteen years to training as a Tibetan Buddhist monk, ordained by H. H. the Dalai Lama, he went on to earn an undergraduate degree in physics and the philosophy of science at Amherst College and a doctorate in religious studies at Stanford.

Where We Belong - by  Hoda Kotb (Paperback),51496550,"  Book Synopsis From New York Times bestselling author and beloved Today show coanchor Hoda Kotb, an ""inspirational page-turner"" (Daily News, New York) about people who find their life's purpose in unexpected ways, often surprising themselves and their loved ones. Are you where you belong? Many of us wonder. We float around in the half-empty glass, gaze out into the world of possibilities, and wonder if we should get off our raft and climb out. Maybe even today you asked yourself: Is it too late to do that thing that made me so happy when I was young? Could what matters most to me finally be the center of my life? Can I really trust this yearning voice in my head and longing in my heart? In Where We Belong, Hoda Kotb explores the challenging journeys of people who found their true calling in life by following their passions, their gut, and their heart. The compelling stories include an investment banker who became a minister after years of working on Wall Street, a young woman from a blue-collar background whose passion took her to Harvard Medical School, a high-powered PR executive who was drawn to a unique close-knit community, and a once ""no-kids"" guy who now helps children all over the world. Hoda also interviews celebrities, such as producer Mark Burnett and actress/producer Roma Downey, comedienne Margaret Cho, and former boxer Laila Ali, all who've pursued their passions to fulfill their dreams. The stories told provide examples of perseverance, self-reflection, and new attitudes on life making Where We Belong a motivating guide to finding the right path for your personal journey.

In the Great Green Room - by  Amy Gary (Paperback),53590868,"  Book Synopsis The extraordinary life of the woman behind the beloved children's classics Goodnight Moon and The Runaway Bunny comes alive in this fascinating biography of Margaret Wise Brown. Margaret's books have sold millions of copies all over the world, but few people know that she was at the center of a children's book publishing revolution. Her whimsy and imagination fueled a steady stream of stories, book ideas, songs, and poems and she was renowned for her prolific writing and business savvy, as well as her stunning beauty and endless thirst for adventure.Margaret started her writing career by helping to shape the curriculum for the Bank Street School for children, making it her mission to create stories that would rise above traditional fairy tales and allowed girls to see themselves as equal to boys. At the same time, she also experimented endlessly with her own writing. Margaret would spend days researching subjects, picking daisies, cloud gazing, and observing nature, all in an effort to precisely capture a child's sense of awe and wonder as they discovered the world.Clever, quirky, and incredibly talented, Margaret embraced life with passion, lived extravagantly off of her royalties, went on rabbit hunts, and carried on long and troubled love affairs with both men and women. Among them were two great loves in Margaret's life. One was a gender-bending poet and the ex-wife of John Barrymore. She went by the stage name of Michael Strange and she and Margaret had a tempestuous yet secret relationship, at one point living next door to each other so that they could be together. After the dissolution of their relationship and Michael's death, Margaret became engaged to a younger man, who also happened to be the son of a Rockefeller and a Carnegie. But before they could marry Margaret died unexpectedly at the age of forty-two, leaving behind a cache of unpublished work and a timeless collection of books that would go on become classics in children's literature.In In the Great Green Room, author Amy Gary captures the eccentric and exceptional life of Margaret Wise Brown, and drawing on newly-discovered personal letters and diaries, reveals an intimate portrait of a creative genius whose unrivaled talent breathed new life in to the literary world.  Review Quotes ""In a biography full of lively anecdotes, this one stands out for the way it encapsulates what must have made Margaret Wise Brown so enchanting to her friends and colleagues.... If the measure of a good life story is the longing it leaves in the reader to have known the subject, this one more than succeeds."" --The Wall Street Journal""Margaret Wise Brown's story reads as a stirring evocation of a woman who insisted on freedom in her art and in her love life."" --USA Today ""In the Great Green Room brings renewed attention to the contrast between Margaret Wise Brown's private life and her status as a celebrated children's author. Drawing on personal letters and diaries, author Amy Gary draws a colorful portrait."" --The Washington Post""[In the Great Green Room] offers compelling insights into this remarkable woman."" --Los Angeles Review of Books""Gary has used her unrivaled familiarity with the author's life and times to craft a vivid portrait.... Gary smoothly intertwines the story of the writing of these now-classic books with the complicated and often tumultuous twists of Brown's personal life, and the effect is both intimate and revelatory."" --The Christian Science Monitor""Goodnight Moon is less a story than an incantation. It summons a cocoon around reader and listener, a sensation of being pulled out of the hurly-burly of the world into a pocket of charmed tranquility. Amy Gary's new biography, In the Great Green Room: The Brilliant and Bold Life of Margaret Wise Brown, replicates this spell for adult readers."" --Slate""Margaret Wise Brown's life--from her revolutionary career to her scandalous love affairs--is offered up to readers and makes for great storytelling--bedtime or otherwise.""--Town & Country Magazine""Amy Gary's In the Great Green Room is as brilliant and bold as the literary life she chronicles. The amazing story of Margaret Wise Brown will inspire readers and all those who would aspire to a Writer's life."" --Terrance G. Finley, Books-A-Million President's Pick""Gary adds to the portrait we have of [Margaret Wise Brown] with never-before-seen materials she uncovered in 1990, including manuscripts, diaries, and letters."" --Publishers Weekly ""For children's literature buffs and fans of intriguing biographies, In the Great Green Room is a must read."" --BookPage""Through Amy Gary's fascinating biography, readers can meet the woman who created [Goodnight Moon], and learn of her remarkable and quite unusual life."" --Bookreporter.com""Measured, wise, and thrilling in its clarity, Amy Gary's In the Great Green Room animates for readers an extraordinary life devoted to satisfying every curiosity and deepening every meaning. Not content with the cosmos as she found them, Margaret Wise Brown renamed the stars until she knew them on her terms. In her generous books, she gave this magical power of recreation to generations of children and their parents. Now, Amy Gary has extended this same gift to Brown."" --Tracy Daugherty, author of The Last Love Song: A Biography of Joan Didion""Amy Gary's In the Great Green Room is a true discovery.... Drawing on unpublished manuscripts, Gary's narrative is informative as it is riveting, creating a lively portrait of a woman writer and editor who deserves to be widely known for her work, while [Margaret Wise] Brown's impulsive desire and emotional vulnerability creates moments that ultimately leave the reader with a sense of both exuberant uplift and haunting loss."" --Irene Gammel, author of Looking for Anne of Green Gables""What a fascinating (and at times melancholy) life.... The author's writing style was captivating and moving...I couldn't stop reading about this extraordinary woman and wished she had received the attention and acclaim she deserved. And a tragic ending of her life and a missed opportunity to finally be happy in a relationship brought me to tears.... [This book] would be an inspiration to anyone wanting to become a writer."" --Robin Beerbower, EarlyWord.com  About the Author In 1990, AMY GARY discovered hundreds of unpublished works by Margaret Wise Brown in Margaret's sister's attic. Since then Gary has catalogued, edited, and researched all of Margaret writings. She has been covered in Vanity Fair, Entertainment Weekly,  and NPR, among other media outlets. She was formerly the director of publishing at Lucasfilm and headed the publishing department at Pixar studios.",https://www.target.com/p/in-the-great-green-room-by-amy-gary-paperback/-/A-53590868,https://target.scene7.com/is/image/Target/GUEST_ced1eafd-c3ce-4202-af18-41932800e58e

It's impossible to overlook Ron Novitski's 1969 Olds® 442™ W-30 with huge ""DR. OLDSMOBILE'S W-MACHINE"" lettering down the sides. It was on display for the ""Class of 1969 Invitational"" display at the 2019 MCACN. Originally, this late-production car was sold new by the Chesrown dealership in Ohio. The current owner purchased it off original buyer with just 22,000 original miles! It was involved in drag racing early in its life until it catastrophically threw a rod rendering the car undrivable. For 30 years, it sat untouched in storage until Ron Novitski bought it. Giving it a second chance on life, Ron enlisted the help of Miller Auto Care Stock Restoration and Restomods to return the car to better- than-new condition. The hard work and meticulous attention to detail earned this show car Gold Status at MCACN! It was set up right next to the Auto World booth, so the entire Auto World crew got to admire this car for the whole show!",https://www.target.com/p/1969-oldsmobile-442-w-30-coupe-dr-oldsmobile-s-w-machine-trophy-blue-met-mcacn-1-18-diecast-model-car-by-autoworld/-/A-82006735,https://target.scene7.com/is/image/Target/GUEST_97900e8a-9210-48bc-a0ff-d122a0883021

9 Historic Revolutions - by  Howard Sherman (Paperback),82565449,"  About the Book This book describes with fascinating detail what happened in the nine greatest revolutions of history. It also explains a progressive theory of history derived from the chapters on the revolutions. Finally, it shows how to apply the theory to the present.  Book Synopsis In concrete terms, the author has been facinated by the many powerful revoutions that have occured during his own lifetime. It is a mystery to many writers exactly how history evolves through different stages of society. REVOLUTION answers this question by looking at the excitng events and different group relationshships that have powered each revolution.  The revolutions revealed in this book include the Neolithic revolution of prehistoric times, the crises and the end of the Roman empire, the rise of feudilsm and serfdom in England and the path was followed to end feudlaism in England forever. The book shows how France went through a bloody revolution against the feudal Lords which resulted in the beginnings of democracy and capitalism throughout Europe.  The complex and difficult revolution against Brittish emperialism iun India is revealed and stand as a sign as an example of many anti colonial revolutions that later occured throughout the world. The revolutionary path then goes through China and Russia. Finally, the patterns of these revolutions in their orgins activity and final explosive activity are examined to see how they all behaved in certain similiar manners- even though the conditions were entirely different in each era. The last chapter in the book present social movements and conflicts as a concluding historical event.  Review Quotes In this impressive work, Howard Sherman uses his mastery of historical analysis and institutional methodology to examine nine of the most important revolutions in world history. He then applies lessons learned from this history to the prospects for progressive change in the US today. A book not to be missed. -- Marty Wolfson, Professor of Economics Emeritus, University of Notre DameIt would be an understatement to warn readers that Professor Sherman's latest book is wide ranging and encyclopedic in scope. Sherman takes readers through nine historic revolutions dating from the Neolithic revolution in the Mideast in 4000 BC to the Chinese Revolution in the mid-twentieth century, and provides a framework for understanding the roles played by technology, class conflict, and social institutions in all these social revolutions. Readers intrigued by social stability and change seeking to understand the forces at play today will find this book, written by someone with a lifetime of experience studying and promoting struggles for progressive social change, both provocative and enlightening. -- Robin Hahnel, Professor Emerita, Portland State UniversityProfessor Howard Sherman has provided us with an eminently readable introduction to the process of historical evolution. He lays out, in clear prose, the conditions and consequences of the nine most revolutionary episodes in human history, the disjuncture of the current moment, and the possibility of a progressive, socialist, alternative. -- Mayo Toruño, Professor Emeritus, California State University, San Bernardino  About the Author Howard J.

Map. Glossary.  Book Synopsis The classic translation of The Odyssey, now in paperback.   This edition also features a map, a Glossary of Names and Places, and Fitzgerald's Postscript. Line drawings precede each book of the poem.  Robert Fitzgerald's translation of Homer's Odyssey is the best and best-loved modern translation of the greatest of all epic poems. Since 1961, this Odyssey has sold more than two million copies, and it is the standard translation for three generations of students and poets. Farrar, Straus and Giroux is delighted to publish a new edition of this classic work.

Of the many translations published since World War II, only Fitzgerald's has won admiration as a great poem in English. The noted classicist D. S. Carne-Ross explains the many aspects of its artistry in his Introduction, written especially for this new edition. Winner of the Bollingen Prize  Review Quotes ""A masterpiece . . .

Homer is a legendary ancient Greek epic poet, traditionally said to be the creator of the epic poems the Iliad and the Odyssey.

This special edition collects issues #21-25 of the main series, as well as the entire Lil' Poopy Superstar miniseries.

Join Summer and Mr. Poopybutthole on their own adventure through fame and misfortune! All that and more in this oversized collection!  About the Author Dan Harmon is the Emmy(R) winning creator/executive producer of the comedy series Community as well as the co-creator/executive producer of Adult Swim's Rick and Morty(TM).  Harmon's pursuit of minimal work for maximum reward took him from stand-up to improv to sketch comedy, then finally to Los Angeles, where he began writing feature screenplays with fellow Milwaukeean Rob Schrab. As part of his deal with Robert Zemeckis at Imagemovers, Harmon co-wrote the feature film Monster House. Following this, Harmon co-wrote the Ben Stiller-directed pilot ""Heat Vision and Jack,"" starring Jack Black and Owen Wilson.  Disillusioned by the legitimate industry, Harmon began attending classes at nearby Glendale Community College. At the same time, Harmon and Schrab founded Channel 101, an untelevised non-profit audience-controlled network for undiscovered filmmakers, many of whom used it to launch mainstream careers, including the boys behind SNL's Digital Shorts. Harmon, along with Schrab, partnered with Sarah Silverman to create her Comedy Central series, The Sarah Silverman Program, where he served as head writer for the first season.  Harmon went on to create, write and perform in the short-lived VH1 sketch series Acceptable TV before eventually creating the critically-acclaimed and fan-favorite comedy Community. The show originally aired on NBC for five seasons before being acquired by Yahoo which premiered season six of the show in March of 2015. In 2009, he won an Emmy for Outstanding Music and Lyrics for the opening number of the 81st Annual Academy Awards.  Along with Justin Roiland, Harmon created the breakout Adult Swim animated series Rick and Morty. The show premiered in December of 2013 and quickly became a ratings hit. Harmon and Roiland have wrapped up season three, which premiered in 2017.  In 2014, Harmon was the star of the documentary Harmontown which premiered at the SXSW Film Festival and chronicled his 20-city stand-up/podcast tour of the same name. The documentary was released theatrically in October of 2014.  Justin Roiland grew up in Manteca, California where he did the basic stuff children do. Later in life he traveled to Los Angeles. Once settled in, he created several popular online shorts for Channel 101. Some notable examples of his work (both animated and live action) include ""House of Cosbys"" and ""Two Girls One Cup: The Show."" Justin is afraid of his mortality and hopes the things he creates will make lots of people happy. Then maybe when modern civilization collapses into chaos, people will remember him and they'll help him survive the bloodshed and violence. Global economic collapse is looming. It's going to be horrible, and honestly, a swift death might be preferable than living in the hell that awaits mankind. Justin also really hates writing about himself in the third person. I hate this. That's right. It's me. I've been writing this whole thing. Hi. The cat's out of the bag. It's just you and me now. There never was a third person. If you want to know anything about me, just ask. Sorry this wasn't more informative.

Her greatest passion is to tell good stories that will inspire others!  Mildred Louis was born and raised in a small town outside of Boston, Massachusetts. Growing up, she always had a passion for comics and cartoons, leading her to study Animation at Sheridan College in Canada.

Book Synopsis Are you bedraggled, beat-up, burnt-out?  Most of us believe in God's grace--in theory. But somehow we can't seem to apply it in our daily lives. We continue to see Him as a small-minded bookkeeper, tallying our failures and successes on a score sheet. Yet God gives us His grace, willingly, no matter what we've done. We come to Him as ragamuffins--dirty, bedraggled, and beat-up. And when we sit at His feet, He smiles upon us, the chosen objects of His ""furious love."" Brennan Manning's now-classic meditation on grace and what it takes to access it--simple honesty--has changed thousands of lives. Now with a Ragamuffin's thirty-day spiritual journey guide, it will change yours, too.

Playful Learning Lab for Kids - by  Claire Heffron & Lauren Drobnjak (Paperback),53998389,"  Book Synopsis Playful Learning Lab for Kids is a hands-on activity book that offers games and activities that revolve around the senses and concepts in reading, math, art, and science.  Recent research has shown that children learn and develop new skills more quickly when they engage in playful, whole body activities. Movement allows them to refocus their attention, improves brain function, reduces stress, and improves circulation. Not only that, but the more senses that are used for learning, the more likely information is to be stored and retrieved.  The activities in Playful Learning Lab for Kids explore concepts in reading, language, math, art, music, science, geography, and social studies, all while engaging children with movements, touch, sound, and sight. Most distinguishing of all, the activities and lessons here include suggestions for tailoring the experience to different levels, making it a book children can grow with. The skills range from visual perceptual skills and spatial awareness, to early geometry concepts, visual motor integration, and fine motor skills.  Authors Claire Heffron and Lauren Drobnjak, pediatric occupational and physical therapists with years of experience in clinical and school-based settings, share their best tips and strategies for helping little learners reach their fullest potential through these engaging and fun activities.  The popular Lab for Kids series features a growing list of books that share hands-on activities and projects on a wide host of topics, including art, astronomy, clay, geology, math, and even how to create your own circus--all authored by established experts in their fields. Each lab contains a complete materials list, clear step-by-step photographs of the process, as well as finished samples. The labs can be used as singular projects or as part of a yearlong curriculum of experiential learning. The activities are open-ended, designed to be explored over and over, often with different results. Geared toward being taught or guided by adults, they are enriching for a range of ages and skill levels. Gain firsthand knowledge on your favorite topic with Lab for Kids.

The Triune God - (New Studies in Dogmatics) by  Fred Sanders (Paperback),51500087,"  About the Book The Triune God aims to secure our knowledge of the triune God by rightly ordering the theological language with which we praise him. It reaches its conclusions about how the doctrine should be handled on the basis of the way the Trinity was revealed. As such, it is a study that offers dogmatic principles for trinitarian exegesis.  Book Synopsis The Triune God aims to secure our knowledge of the triune God by rightly ordering the theological language with which we praise him. It reaches its conclusions about how the doctrine should be handled on the basis of the way the Trinity was revealed. As such, it is a study that offers dogmatic principles for Trinitarian exegesis. Half of the volume establishes the biblical exposition and draws the doctrinal implications from it, showing that Trinitarianism is a gift of revelation before it is an achievement of the church. Sanders interacts with major voices from the history of doctrine, and his arguments are indebted to and informed by the great tradition of Trinitarianism. But the fitting way to retrieve the insights of the church fathers is not to pay more attention to them than to Scripture. The most patristic way to proceed toward a well-ordered doctrine of the Trinity is, after all, to study Scripture.The New Studies in Dogmatics series seeks to retrieve the riches of Christian doctrine for the sake of contemporary theological renewal. Following in the tradition of G. C. Berkouwer's Studies in Dogmatics, this series will provide thoughtful, concise, and readable treatments of major theological topics, expressing the biblical, creedal, and confessional shape of Christian doctrine for a contemporary evangelical audience. The editors and contributors share a common conviction that the way forward in constructive systematic theology lies in building upon the foundations laid in the church's historic understanding of the Word of God as professed in its creeds, councils, and confessions, and by its most trusted teachers.  About the Author Fred Sanders (PhD, Graduate Theological Union) is professor of theology in the Torrey Honors Institute at Biola University in La Mirada, California. He is author of numerous books including The Deep Things of God: How the Trinity Changes Everything and Dr. Doctrines' Christian Comix. He is co-editor of Jesus in Trinitarian Perspective: An Introductory Christology. Fred is a core participant in the Theological Engagement with California Culture Project and a popular blogger at Scriptorium Daily.",https://www.target.com/p/the-triune-god-new-studies-in-dogmatics-by-fred-sanders-paperback/-/A-51500087,https://target.scene7.com/is/image/Target/GUEST_5bf56375-dd98-4b72-a523-48ec39273538

Crome Yellow - (British Literature) by  Aldous Huxley (Paperback),11793328,"  Book Synopsis On vacation from school, Denis goes to stay at Crome, an English country house inhabitated by several of Huxley's most outlandish characters--from Mr. Barbecue-Smith, who writes 1,500 publishable words an hour by ""getting in touch"" with his ""subconscious,"" to Henry Wimbush, who is obsessed with writing the definitive HISTORY OF CROME. Denis's stay proves to be a disaster amid his weak attempts to attract the girl of his dreams and the ridicule he endures regarding his plan to write a novel about love and art. Lambasting the post-Victorian standards of morality, CROME YELLOW is a witty masterpiece that, in F. Scott Fitzgerald's words, ""is too irnonic to be called satire and too scornful to be called irony.""  Review Quotes ""Fine satirical writing. Crome Yellow is determinedly eccentric and unflaggingly delightful.""--Bookman  About the Author Aldous Huxley, was a British writer. He was born on July 26, 1894 and died on November 22, 1963.

The Road Not Taken - by  David Orr (Paperback),51503707,"  Book Synopsis A cultural ""biography"" of Robert Frost's beloved poem, arguably the most popular piece of American literature   ""Two roads diverged in a yellow wood . . ."" One hundred years after its first publication in August 1915, Robert Frost's poem ""The Road Not Taken"" is so ubiquitous that it's easy to forget that it is, in fact, a poem. Yet poetry it is, and Frost's immortal lines remain unbelievably popular. And yet in spite of this devotion, almost everyone gets the poem hopelessly wrong.  David Orr's The Road Not Taken dives directly into the controversy, illuminating the poem's enduring greatness while revealing its mystifying contradictions. Widely admired as the poetry columnist for the New York Times Book Review, Orr is the perfect guide for lay readers and experts alike. Orr offers a lively look at the poem's cultural influence, its artistic complexity, and its historical journey from the margins of the First World War all the way to its canonical place today as a true masterpiece of American literature.  ""The Road Not Taken"" seems straightforward: a nameless traveler is faced with a choice: two paths forward, with only one to walk. And everyone remembers the traveler taking ""the one less traveled by, / And that has made all the difference."" But for a century readers and critics have fought bitterly over what the poem really says. Is it a paean to triumphant self-assertion, where an individual boldly chooses to live outside conformity? Or a biting commentary on human self-deception, where a person chooses between identical roads and yet later romanticizes the decision as life altering?  What Orr artfully reveals is that the poem speaks to both of these impulses, and all the possibilities that lie between them. The poem gives us a portrait of choice without making a decision itself. And in this, ""The Road Not Taken"" is distinctively American, for the United States is the country of choice in all its ambiguous splendor.  Published for the poem's centennial--along with a new Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition of Frost's poems, edited and introduced by Orr himself--The Road Not Taken is a treasure for all readers, a triumph of artistic exploration and cultural investigation that sings with its own unforgettably poetic voice.  Praise for The Road Not Taken   ""The most satisfying part of Orr's fresh appraisal of 'The Road Not Taken' is the reappraisal it can inspire in longtime Frost readers whose readings have frozen solid. The crossroads between the poet and the man is where Frost leaves his poems for us to discover, turning what seems like a fork in the road into a site of limitless potential."" --The Boston Globe  Review Quotes Publishers Weekly:  ""Orr blends theory, biography, psychology, science, and a healthy dose of pop culture into a frothy mix so fun, readers may forget they're learning something."" Kirkus Reviews ""Orr presents a fresh, perceptive reading of the verse; places it in the context of Frost's life, other works, and public persona; and considers the meaning of choice in American culture. An illuminating voyage into the heart of Frost's poem and the American spirit.""   Library Journal  ""This entertaining book will appeal to poetry and American literature lovers, as well as to readers interested in the interweaving of art and culture."" New York Times Book ReviewDavid Orr has written the best popular explanation to date of the most popular poem in American history. Wall Street Journal  [David Orr's] achievement in this shrewd and patient book lies in connecting Frost's deceptively folksy manner with the very things that make him matter. Christian Science MonitorOrr is fascinated by why so many have read this poem so positively for so long, and what this fact reveals about the American soul. The Boston GlobeThe most satisfying part of Orr's fresh appraisal of ""The Road Not Taken"" is the reappraisal it can inspire in longtime Frost readers whose readings have frozen solid. The crossroads between the poet and the man is where Frost leaves his poems for us to discover, turning what seems like a fork in the road into a site of limitless potential, 'in which all decisions are equally likely.'

The Boys in the Boat (Young Readers Adaptation) - by  Daniel James Brown (Paperback),51526693,"  About the Book ""Out of the depths of the Great Depression comes the astonishing tale of nine working-class boys from the American West who at the 1936 Olympics showed the world what true grit really meant. With rowers who were the sons of loggers, shipyard workers, and farmers, the University of Washington's eight-oar crew was never expected to defeat the elite East Coast teams, yet they did, going on to shock the world by challenging the German boat rowing for Adolf Hitler""--  Book Synopsis The #1 New York Times bestseller freshly adapted for the next generation, now with brand new content including an author Q&A and never-before-seen photographs Inspiration for the PBS American Experience Documentary 'The Boys of '36' For readers of Unbroken, out of the depths of the Great Depression comes the astonishing tale of nine working-class boys from the American West who at the 1936 Olympics showed the world what true grit really meant. With rowers who were the sons of loggers, shipyard workers, and farmers, the University of Washington's eight-oar crew was never expected to defeat the elite East Coast teams, yet they did, going on to shock the world by challenging the German boat rowing for Adolf Hitler.  At the center of the tale is Joe Rantz, a teenager without family or prospects, whose personal quest captures the spirit of his generation--the generation that would prove in the coming years that the Nazis could not prevail over American determination and optimism.  This deeply emotional yet easily accessible young readers adaptation of the award-winning #1 New York Times bestseller features never-before-seen photographs, highly visual back matter, and an exclusive new introduction.  Review Quotes Accolades for The Boys in the Boat (Young Readers Adaptation):  - New York Times bestseller- #1 Pacific Northwest Bookseller Assocation bestseller The word teamwork, which can sound humdrum to kids in coaches' droning lectures, doesn't adequately describe the connection shared by the men in that boat in 1936. Illustrated with vintage photos, this moving book offers young people a vivid sense of that shared experience. A Depression-era story with timeless appeal. --Booklist, starred review Offering a model of masterful nonfiction writing, Brown expertly balances the leisurely pacing of the protagonists' back stories with the exciting race scenes, related with concrete nouns, lively verbs, and short sentences, selected and adapted for this edition by Mone. Many photographs, an easy-to-read timeline, and notes on The Art of Rowing, complete with a diagram, add visual appeal. A fine companion to Laura Hillenbrand's Unbroken (2014), also about the 1936 Olympics and also adapted for young readers. --Kirkus Those seeking an inspiring true story or a great sports tale will be pleased with this stirring work. --School Library Journal It becomes almost impossible not to root for such a hardscrabble collection of underdogs as they exhibit hard work, sacrifice, teamwork, and loyalty at every stage of their collective journey to Berlin. --Horn Book With a lyrical flair, Brown tells the story of these men in a manner that intersperses the drama of the time period with the emotional and physical turmoil of their lives. Young adult readers may not understand or even know about the desperation of the Depression, or what it was like at the genesis of Nazi Germany, but the tale of these persistent men, each with their own personal struggle, will entice readers of all ages. --VOYA Accolades for the adult edition of The Boys in the Boat - #1 New York Times bestseller- 2014 ABA Adult Nonfiction Book of the Year- 2014 Washington State Book Award A suspenseful tale of triumph. --USA Today Evocative, cinematic prose. --Publishers Weekly This is Chariots of Fire with oars. --David Laskin, author of The Children's Blizzard A great and inspiring true story. --Nathaniel Philbrick, author of Mayflower A thrilling, heart-thumping tale. --Timothy Egan, author of The Worst Hard Time A robust, emotional snapshot of an era. --James Bradley, author of Flags of Our Fathers   About the Author Daniel James Brown is the author of two previous nonfiction books, The Indifferent Stars Above and Under a Flaming Sky, which was a finalist for a Barnes & Noble Discover Award.

Dark Ages Board Game,76024023,"Times have been hard. To save on money, you've moved out of your old castle, and into a luxurious ravine. You didn't like that castle anyway; it was always getting looted, and never at a reasonable hour. And if it wasn't barbarians it was the plague, or sometimes both would come at once, and there wouldn't be enough chairs. The ravine is great; you get lots of sun, and you can just drop garbage wherever you want. In your free time you've taken up begging. Begging is brilliant conceptually, but tricky in practice, since no-one has any money. You beg twigs from the villagers, and they beg them back, but no-one really seems to come out ahead. That's just how life is sometimes. You're quietly conquering people, minding your own business, when suddenly there's a plague, or barbarians, or everyone's illiterate, and it's all you can do to cling to some wreckage as the storm passes through. Still, you are sure that, as always, you will triumph over this adversity, or at least do slightly better than everyone else.This is the 7th addition to the game of Dominion. It is 500 cards but is not a standalone. It adds 35 new Kingdom cards to Dominion, plus new bad cards you give to other players (Ruins), new cards to replace starting Estates (Shelters), and cards you can only get via specific other cards.

"Worx WG252 20"" - 20V Pole Hedge Trimmer with 13' Reach, 10-Position Head, Rotating Handle",82154171,"Sure, it’s easy to see when your hedges are getting a little shaggy, but how about your trees? The Worx 20V 2-in-1 Attachment-Capable Hedge Trimmer will clean up every bush, shrub, tree, and hedge on your property. Dual-action blades cut everything twice, once forward, and once back, working at 1340 revs/min. And all that action gives you neat, clean cuts.

The extendable pole attachment is the greatest feature, though. You can leave the ladder in the garage and still add about 12 feet to your reach. It’s the much safer way to trim your trees. And once it’s up there, the pole handle has an on/off switch right on the grip, so you can turn it on and shut it off without having to bring it back down. This tool is cordless, so you don’t have to worry about getting snagged on every branch and obstacle in your yard. The included 2.0 Ah battery and charger will keep your trimmer powered up and ready to go. This model also comes with a blade sheath, which makes it safer to store and significantly extends the life of your tool. And if you decide later on that your trees need some branches to come down, too, you can always get the Worx Chainsaw Head Attachment that is designed for this pole.",https://www.target.com/p/worx-wg252-20-20v-pole-hedge-trimmer-with-13-reach-10-position-head-rotating-handle/-/A-82154171,https://target.scene7.com/is/image/Target/GUEST_07e8ed9c-b245-41e2-94b4-f8bab2cf58bb

"Carry On, Mr. Bowditch - by  Jean Lee Latham (Paperback)",11820229,"  About the Book Winner of the 1956 Newbery Medal, this novel tells the story of 18th-century mathematical wizard Nathaniel Bowditch, whose determination to master sea navigation resulted in ""The American Practical Navigator.""  Book Synopsis 1957 Newbery Medal Winner  Readers today are still fascinated by ""Nat,"" an eighteenth-century nautical wonder and mathematical wizard. Nathaniel Bowditch grew up in a sailor's world--Salem in the early days, when tall-masted ships from foreign ports crowded the wharves. But Nat didn't promise to have the makings of a sailor; he was too physically small. Nat may have been slight of build, but no one guessed that he had the persistence and determination to master sea navigation in the days when men sailed only by ""log, lead, and lookout."" Nat's long hours of study and observation, collected in his famous work, The American Practical Navigator (also known as the ""Sailors' Bible""), stunned the sailing community and made him a New England hero.

The Leaving - by  Tara Altebrando (Hardcover),51546162,"  About the Book Six were taken. Eleven years later, five come back--with no idea of where they've been. A riveting mystery for fans of We Were Liars.  Book Synopsis Six were taken. Eleven years later, five come back--with no idea of where they've been. A riveting mystery for fans of We Were Liars. Eleven years ago, six kindergartners went missing without a trace. After all that time, the people left behind moved on, or tried to. Until today. Today five of those kids return. They're sixteen, and they are . . . fine. Scarlett comes home and finds a mom she barely recognizes, and doesn't really recognize the person she's supposed to be, either. But she thinks she remembers Lucas. Lucas remembers Scarlett, too, except they're entirely unable to recall where they've been or what happened to them. Neither of them remember the sixth victim, Max--the only one who hasn't come back. Which leaves Max's sister, Avery, wanting answers. She wants to find her brother--dead or alive--and isn't buying this whole memory-loss story. But as details of the disappearance begin to unfold, no one is prepared for the truth. This unforgettable novel--with its rich characters, high stakes, and plot twists--will leave readers breathless.  Review Quotes You will not sleep, check your phone or even breathe once you begin reading The Leaving. Altebrando hides a meditation on memory and identity inside a top-speed page-turner. I promise, you will not even look up from the page. - E. Lockhart, author of WE WERE LIARS The Leaving isn't one of those books that creeps up on you: instead, it throws you in the back of an unmarked van and speeds off before you even have time to wonder what's going on. This book gripped me on the first page, and by the last, had really moved me. It's a twisty, oh no she didn't thriller that keeps the surprises firing, but also a thoughtful meditation on memory, identity, and what really makes us who we are. - Bennett Madison, author of SEPTEMBER GIRLS As heart-stopping as it is heart-breaking,  The Leaving layers a wildly strange suspense story over a lovely and unexpected narrative of grief, loss, and the struggle to imagine a future in the shadow of the past. - Robin Wasserman, author of GIRLS ON FIRE Bold, inventive, and engaging, The Leaving leaps straight off the page. - Beth Kephart, author of SMALL DAMAGES and THIS IS THE STORY OF YOU This is no mere thriller; folded into this compulsively readable work are thought-provoking themes. . . . Teens who enjoy engrossing, contemplative titles such as Adam Silvera's More Happy Than Not will devour this insightful musing on memory and identity. - starred review,  School Library Journal A twisting, harrowing story . . . Engrossing, both as a thriller and a meditation on memory--its limits, its loss, and the ways it deceives and constructs identity. - starred review,  Publishers Weekly A twisting and turning mystery that will grip readers. - Kirkus Reviews Told in a complicated layering, Altebrando constructs an amazing story about the lives of those taken and of those who tried to carry on back home. - VOYA With a bit of romance, a bit of pathos, a bit of science fiction, and a bit of ripped-from-the-headlines trauma, this will appeal to fans of mystery. - BCCB Highly satisfying . . . A believable and clever story that will keep readers engaged from beginning to end. - Booklist  About the Author Tara Altebrando is the author of several middle grade and teen novels, including Roomies, an ALA 2014 Best Fiction for Young Adults pick, co-written with Sara Zarr.

Hot Water Music - by  Charles Bukowski (Paperback),11796171,"  About the Book Originally published: Santa Barbara, CA: Black Sparrow Press, c1983.  Book Synopsis With his characteristic raw and minimalist style, Charles Bukowski takes us on a walk through his side of town in Hot Water Music. He gives us little vignettes of depravity and lasciviousness, bite sized pieces of what is both beautiful and grotesque.The stories in Hot Water Music dash around the worst parts of town - a motel room stinking of sick, a decrepit apartment housing a perpetually arguing couple, a bar tended by a skeleton - and depict the darkest parts of human existence. Bukowski talks simply and profoundly about the underbelly of the working class without raising judgement. In the way he writes about sex, relationships, writing, and inebriation, Bukowski sets the bar for irreverent art - his work inhabits the basest part of the mind and the most extreme absurdity of the everyday.   From the Back Cover Hot Water Music is a collection of short stories by Charles Bukowski, published in 1983. The collection deals largely with: drinking, women, gambling, and writing. It is an important collection that establishes Bukowski's minimalist style and his thematic oeuvre.",https://www.target.com/p/hot-water-music-by-charles-bukowski-paperback/-/A-11796171,https://target.scene7.com/is/image/Target/GUEST_7da06e97-406a-4dbe-a3e3-d1df6438d18c

Bill Belichick vs. the NFL - by  Erik Frenz (Paperback),51547342,"  Book Synopsis Bill Belichick started collecting Lombardi Trophies like some people collect coasters and won his fourth Super Bowl title in 2015. No other NFL team has been as successful since Belichick became the Patriots' head coach in 2000, winning titles after the 2001, 2003, 2004, and 2014 seasons, along with Super Bowl appearances after the 2007 and 2011 seasons. But is Belichick the best NFL coach of all time? In Bill Belichick vs. the NFL, author Erik Frenz not only explains what separates Belichick from his peers and compares his accomplishments to some of the all-time legends, but tells why, if there were a Mount Rushmore of NFL coaches, Belichick's face would already be on it. From his upbringing as a coach's son to learning under Bill Parcells to creating his own coaching tree, he has established a new standard that may be unparalleled in football history.  About the Author Erik Frenz is a NFL writer currently covering the Patriots and the AFC East for Bleacher Report and Boston.com. He lives in Watertown, Massachusetts.

In The Tapping Solution for Parents, Children & Teenagers, New York Times best-selling author Nick Ortner encourages readers to take a look at the amount of stress and worry in their lives as parents, reminding readers that self-care is critical.

In the second section of the book, Nick explores specific uses for Tapping with children, ranging from releasing negative emotions like anger, fear and phobias, to dealing with sadness, grief, guilt and shame. This powerful technique can even help with specific challenges such as: - anxiety disorders- difficulties with sleep- nightmares- performance anxiety- bullying- school jitters- divorceand much more. Nick emphasizes the importance of teaching children the social and emotional skills they need for success in life, school and work. This book will guide parents in using EFT Tapping to help their children learn how to handle challenges by means of self-reflection, self-regulation and overall greater self-awareness.

This treasure trove of a text provides exactly the tools you need to heal, protect, and find balance -- for yourself and your little ones.-- Kelly Brogan, M.D., holistic psychiatrist and author of the New York Times bestseller A Mind of Your Own It has been said that the wounds of the 8th grade have the half life of uranium. In truth, many people carry the wounds and shame of their childhood and schooling right on into adulthood and then pass them on to their children.But it doesn't have to be this way. There is a scientifically based method that changes the way the mind and body respond to stress... transforming it into empowerment and lifelong skills for living well.In The Tapping Solution for Parents, Children & Teenagers, Nick Ortner gives you all the tools you need to help you and your kids live a healthier, more stress-resilient life. I also happen to know Nick and his wonderful extended family. All of them are living proof that this practical approach works. And it's at your fingertips.

Too many are feeling lost and hopeless. The Tapping Solution for Parents, Children & Teenagers may be just what they and their parents need to bring their lives back in balance. This book gives me hope about our collective future.-- Kris Carr, New York Times best-selling author (and EFT lover) If you're human, you most likely experienced a traumatic event in your childhood. Unfortunately, most of us grew up without any way of processing, communicating, and releasing these painful events. It doesn't need to be this way for our kids. Nick Ortner has a breakthrough technique that your child can use to recalibrate and empower themselves in those dark moments, and he is going to teach you how to bring it into your daily life. This book is a must-read for parents and kids of all ages -- consider it first aid for your child's self-esteem and mental wellness. As a father of two young boys, I highly recommend it!-- Nick Polizzi, founder of The Sacred ScienceThe most important responsibility nature bestows on every new parent is to raise offspring who are happy, healthy, and able to contribute to and advance their culture. This challenge has never been greater than it is today.Fortunately, we have at our disposal powerful practices that were not available to our parents or any generation before them.Nick Ortner brings some of the most potent of these tools to every parent and child who wishes to learn them, and he offers these resources in a wonderfully practical and accessible format.-- Donna Eden and David Feinstein, co-authors of The Promise of Energy Psychology and The Energies of LoveIn a time where video games and searching the internet are the number one activities for beating stress amongst our teens, there is a need for something more effective.This wonderful resource for teens as well as younger children and parents teaches an extremely effective stress management tool, and Nick presents it in a very easy-to-learn way. An absolute must for any coffee table at home.-- Peta Stapleton, PhD, author of EFT for Teens,  Tapping in the Classroom and The Science Behind Tapping The two hardest things about being a parent are: How can we take care of ourselves when there are others who rely on us being present, and wondering if we're going to do something wrong to mess them up for life?Nick's work has helped our family learn the tools to help lessen the worry and fear around raising kids. We've used these techniques for ourselves to address our fears of being parents and to calm ourselves down when we're on the edge. We've also used tapping with our children to help our son relax when he's having a tantrum, and even using it to help our daughter with toilet training!We highly, highly recommend this book!-- Kevin and Annmarie Gianni, founders of Annmarie Gianni Skin Care  About the Author NICOLAS ORTNER is the Founder and CEO of The Tapping Solution, LLC. He has been a leader in the movement to introduce EFT (Emotional Freedom Techniques), an innovative self-care method of healing, into the mainstream. EFT Tapping is a simple, effective, natural healing method that combines ancient Chinese acupressure and modern psychology. Nick has shared this powerful technique with millions of people, helping them to connect with their unique potential, take control of their personal health and healing, and manifest happy, productive, abundant lives. Nick Ortner is the New York Times best-selling author of The Tapping Solution: A Revolutionary System for Stress-Free Living, and The Tapping Solution for Pain Relief: A Step-by-Step Guide to Reducing and Eliminating Chronic Pain. Nick's newest book, The Tapping Solution for Manifesting Your Greatest Self: 21 Days to Releasing Self-Doubt, Cultivating Inner Peace, and Creating a Life You Love, guides readers through a 21-day process of self-discovery and self-development. Prior to the publication of these books, Nick created and produced the breakthrough documentary film The Tapping Solution, which follows ten people who used Tapping to overcome significant challenges, including chronic back pain, fibromyalgia, insomnia, devastating grief and more. Nick's books and film document real and extraordinary results that have inspired tens of thousands to follow suit by successfully applying Tapping in their lives. His online events and speaking engagements have been attended by participants all over the world. Nick has also produced first-of-their-kind online programs that teach easy, effective ways to apply EFT Tapping to anything limiting a person's life or health. Some noteworthy examples are: The Tapping World Summit, a free, annual worldwide online event that has been attended by over 1,000,000 people (www.tappingworldsummit.com) and Nick's popular seven-week EFT coaching programs, which provide guidance on achieving common personal objectives such as financial abundance, weight loss and more. Nick is co-founder of The Tapping Solution Foundation and an active board member of The National Institute of Integrative Healthcare and The Jesse Lewis Choose Love Movement. Nick and the Tapping Solution team are committed to spreading Tapping throughout the world, and in particular to supporting its revolutionary and life-changing use. Together, they have raised over $1,000,000 for tapping-related charities such as Project Light, which aids genocide orphans in Rwanda, Africa (www.projectlightrwanda.com), The Veterans Stress Project, supporting veterans with PTSD (www.stressproject.org), You Can Thrive!, a New York organization providing services for women with cancer (www.youcanthrive.org) in addition to working with The Jesse Lewis Choose Love Movement to provide Tapping lessons for their social and emotional learning curriculum (jesselewischooselove.org).

Elon Musk - by  Ashlee Vance (Paperback),51557545,"  About the Book ""With new and updated material"" -- Cover.  Book Synopsis In the spirit of Steve Jobs and Moneyball, Elon Musk is both an illuminating and authorized look at the extraordinary life of one of Silicon Valley's most exciting, unpredictable, and ambitious entrepreneurs--a real-life Tony Stark--and a fascinating exploration of the renewal of American invention and its new ""makers.""Elon Musk spotlights the technology and vision of Elon Musk, the renowned entrepreneur and innovator behind SpaceX, Tesla, and SolarCity, who sold one of his Internet companies, PayPal, for $1.5 billion. Ashlee Vance captures the full spectacle and arc of the genius's life and work, from his tumultuous upbringing in South Africa and flight to the United States to his dramatic technical innovations and entrepreneurial pursuits.Vance uses Musk's story to explore one of the pressing questions of our age: can the nation of inventors and creators who led the modern world for a century still compete in an age of fierce global competition? He argues that Musk--one of the most unusual and striking figures in American business history--is a contemporary, visionary amalgam of legendary inventors and industrialists including Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, Howard Hughes, and Steve Jobs. More than any other entrepreneur today, Musk has dedicated his energies and his own vast fortune to inventing a future that is as rich and far-reaching as the visionaries of the golden age of science-fiction fantasy.Thorough and insightful, Elon Musk brings to life a technology industry that is rapidly and dramatically changing by examining the life of one of its most powerful and influential titans.  From the Back Cover Veteran technology journalist Ashlee Vance offers an unprecedented look into the remarkable life of the most daring entrepreneur of our time. Elon Musk paints a portrait of a complex man who has renewed American industry and sparked new levels of innovation--from PayPal to Tesla, SpaceX, and SolarCity--overcoming hardship, earning billions, and making plenty of enemies along the way.  Review Quotes ""[A] spirited and riveting biography.""--Wall Street Journal""[T]his work will likely serve as the definitive account of a man whom so far we've seen mostly through caricature. By the final pages, too, any reader will sense the need to put comparisons to Steve Jobs aside. Give Musk credit. There is no one like him.""--New York Times Book Review""Fascinating and superbly researched...""--The Guardian UK""Mr. Vance tells the stories of both SpaceX and Tesla with intricacy and insight. . . . What does come through is a sense of legitimate wonder at what humans can accomplish when they aim high, and aim weird.--Dwight Garner, New York Times""The SpaceX and Tesla founder certainly sees setbacks as an unavoidable part of innovation. But a brilliant new biography paints a picture of him as an obsessive, intolerant perfectionist.""--Financial Times",https://www.target.com/p/elon-musk-by-ashlee-vance-paperback/-/A-51557545,https://target.scene7.com/is/image/Target/GUEST_da2c7078-ed4f-488c-a9d3-e9860f9d2b23
